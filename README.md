Files should be read in the following order:

1- Files_Hamzah: This file includes R code for reading the rMATS results that I started with, creating tidy files for the alternative splicing events, displaying some plots, and preparing the GSEA files.
2- GTF: This file contains R code for analyzing the human genome GTF file, extracting relevant information for affected/unaffected genes, and performing statistical tests for each feature.
3- Cell_Lines: This file includes R code for analyzing the significant genes across different cell lines datasets.
4- Splicing events: This file includes R code for analyzing the significant genes across different splicing events datasets.
5- GC: This file includes Python code for analyzing GC content.
6- Splice_Sites_Strengths: This file includes Python code for analyzing splice site strengths.
7- TF: This file includes code in R for the Transcription factor (TF) gene sets analysis.
8- rMAPS: This folder includes R code files for analyzing RNA-binding protein (RBP) motifs in different datasets using rMAPS results.
