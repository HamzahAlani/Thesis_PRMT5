Files should be read in the following order:
#1- Files_Hamzah (This file includes code in R for reading the rMATS results that I started with, creating tidy files for the alternative splicing events, and it shows some plots as well as preparing the GSEA files)
#2- GTF (This file includes code in R for analyzing the human genome GTF file and extracting the relative information from it for the affected/unaffected genes, as well as statistical tests for each feature) 
#3- Cell_Lines (This file includes code in R for the analyzing the different significant genes between the cell lines datasets)
#4- Splicing events (This file includes code in R for the analyzing the different significant genes between the splicing events datasets) 
#5- GC (This file includes code in Python for analyzing GC content)
#6- Splice_Sites_Strengths (This file includes code in Python for analyzing splice sites strengths)
#7- TF (This file includes code in R for the Transcription factor (TF) gene sets analysis)
#8- rMAPS (This folder includes R code files for analyzing RNA-binding protein (RBP) motifs in different datasets using rMAPS results)
